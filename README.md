# zarf_proof_of_Concept

> https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/zarf_proof_of_Concept/index.html

A proof of concept running **Zarf** in GitHub Codespaces with minikube — exploring the Zarf packaging system and shipping a private Zarf package on top of a public hello-world site. Built on the [delivery-pilot-template](https://github.com/rifaterdemsahin/delivery-pilot-template): a structured 7-stage framework with 7 dedicated agents that guide the journey from problem definition to validated deployment — with each agent owning its stage and communicating through a shared thinking log.

**How the agents communicate**: All 7 agents write their reasoning to `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`. Upstream agents log their decisions; downstream agents read those logs before acting. The Semblance Agent closes the loop by feeding resolved errors and lessons back to the Real Agent.

## Why Use This Template? — Self-Learning Through Agentic Feedback

This template is designed as a **self-learning platform** — every project built with it becomes smarter over time. The 7-stage structure with 7 dedicated agents creates closed-loop learning:

| Agent | Learning Mechanism |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Real Agent** | Evolves responsibility — scans the status quo, updates `risks.md` with new risks, applies mitigations |
| **Environment Agent** | Compares models/tools, tracks costs, suggests optimizations — recorded in `costs.md` |
| **Simulation Agent** | Creates versioned designs — every iteration is preserved for comparison |
| **Formula Agent** | Specs are versioned and checked against incoming tasks — warns when behavior conflicts |
| **Symbols Agent** | Coding rules in `5_Symbols/rules/` enforce consistency — lessons become standards |
| **Test Agent + Semblance Agent** | **Sub-synthesis loop**: Test finds errors → Semblance fixes + analyzes → creates sub-agents to mitigate root causes → lessons fed back to Real Agent |

**The feedback loop**: Every error found in `7_Testing_Known` flows through `6_Semblance/` (as documented fixes and lessons), then back to the Real Agent. The Real Agent uses this to update `risks.md` and adjust task priorities. Over time, the project learns from every mistake — each resolved error makes the system stronger.

## 🧠 Cognitive Mapping — 7 Stages to Self-Learning

The framework mimics how humans learn: recognize ignorance, build context, visualize, synthesize, execute, get feedback, and consolidate.

| Stage | Folder | Cognitive Step | Agent |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | `1_Real_Unknown` | **Active Ignorance** — State what you don't know | Real Agent |
| 2 | `2_Environment` | **Mental Sandbox** — Build context and constraints | Environment Agent |
| 3 | `3_Simulation` | **Visualization** — Make the invisible visible | Simulation Agent |
| 4 | `4_Formula` | **Synthesis** — Plan, spec, and decide | Formula Agent |
| 5 | `5_Symbols` | **Execution** — Turn plans into reality | Symbols Agent |
| 7 | `7_Testing_Known` | **Validation** — Prove it works | Test Agent |
| 6 | `6_Semblance` | **Feedback Loop** — Learn from errors, improve | Semblance Agent |

## Refactor

Copy-paste this prompt into an agent working in an **existing** repo. It must follow the template standing orders (`5_Symbols/rules/agent_operating_rules.md`).

```
Refactor this existing project onto the delivery-pilot-template:
https://github.com/rifaterdemsahin/delivery-pilot-template

Read first: agents.md and 5_Symbols/rules/agent_operating_rules.md (RULE-001 through RULE-005).

RULE-001 — After each change, formulate what you did as a spec in 4_Formula/specs.md. Log reasoning in 4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md.
RULE-002 — After every logical change, commit and push. Do not batch unrelated work. Never commit secrets.
RULE-003 — Apps with a backend deploy to Cloudflare Workers (lightweight, stateless) or Fly.io (heavy containers). Both take credentials from Azure Key Vault. Static frontends stay on GitHub Pages.
RULE-004 — Default storage is Azure project-based storage (project-scoped blobs). Do not default to Fly volumes, R2, or git LFS.
RULE-005 — Allowed root folders only:
  .claude/skills
  .github/workflows
  .kilo/skills
  1_Real_Unknown
  2_Environment
  3_Simulation
  4_Formula
  5_Symbols
  6_Semblance
  7_Testing_Known
Move every other root file or folder into the related subfolder of those (git mv, then fix references).
Keep at repo root only: index.html, README.md, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, .gitignore, .env.example, navigation_config.json, agents.md + LLM persona files.

Replace template placeholders. Map existing files into those folders. Fix broken links.

Secrets: use this Key Vault and do NOT create a new one:
  /vaults/dp-kv-deliverypilot/secrets
Save and load all credentials there (Fly.io, Cloudflare Workers, Azure Storage, APIs).

Pull needed skills from popular GitHub skill repos. Place Claude skills in .claude/skills, Kilo skills in .kilo/skills, workflows in .github/workflows.

Then:
  python3 5_Symbols/toolbox/nav_sync.py
  python3 5_Symbols/toolbox/smoke_test.py
Commit and push each logical step (RULE-002).
```

## Init

Copy-paste this prompt to **start** a project from the template. Fill in the goal lines.
