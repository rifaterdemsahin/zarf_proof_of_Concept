# 🧠 LLM Thinking Phase & Reasoning Log

This log documents the thinking phase summaries and reasoning processes of the Large Language Model after executions, as defined in `agents.md`.

---

## 📅 2026-05-30 — Update agents.md Rules (Add LLM Thinking Documentation Rule)

### 📥 Input / Task
- Add rule to `agents.md` instructing LLM agents to document their thinking phase summary in `4_Formula` after executions.
- Update `prompts.md` with prompt details and what was done.
- Follow up by documenting the LLM's own thinking phase for this execution.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Understanding the Goal**: The user wants agents to be more transparent about their internal reasoning process/thinking phase by logging summaries of that thinking in the `4_Formula` folder.
2. **Updating the Framework Rules**:
   - Location: `agents.md` -> Under the `4_Formula` stage definition.
   - Updated wording: added the sentence explicitly detailing the new requirement: "Also, document a summary of the Large Language Model's thinking phase/reasoning process in this folder after executions."
3. **Determining the Action to Perform**:
   - Modify `agents.md` to include the rule.
   - Update `prompts.md` to log the prompt and the action taken.
   - Create a log file (`4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`) to document the LLM's thinking phase of this execution, adhering to the newly created rule.
4. **Execution & Verification**:
   - Apply file changes to `agents.md` and `prompts.md`.
   - Create the log file in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md` detailing these steps.
   - Ensure changes are committed and pushed incrementally/per task as required.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Modified `agents.md` successfully.
- Modified `prompts.md` to log the new prompt.
- Created `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md` to start tracking thinking logs.
- All modifications committed and pushed to main.

## 📅 2026-05-30 — Template Sanity Check Report

### 📥 Input / Task
- Sanity check project template format to create new projects and use it as a self-learning platform.
- Place the report in the `7_Testing_Known` folder (referenced by the user as the `7_testing_unknown` folder).
- Log the prompt in `prompts.md` and document the LLM thinking phase here in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Goal Identification**: Assess the project template to identify structural completeness, consistency, fitness as a bootstrapping tool, and fitness as a self-learning platform.
2. **Analysis of Template Structure**:
   - Inspected all folders `1_Real_Unknown` through `7_Testing_Known`.
   - Identified that while directory structures and stage READMEs are well-drafted, key files required by the template rules themselves (e.g. `index.html` at the root, `markdown_renderer.html` at the root, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`) are completely missing from the template codebase.
   - Identified minor discrepancies in checklists (empty comment placeholders for YouTube video embeds, `7_Testing_Known` directory name vs user's reference `7_testing_unknown`).
3. **Formulating Recommendations**:
   - Proposed immediate actions to create the missing root files.
   - Proposed providing skeleton/template files inside stage directories to make it easy for users to boot a project, instead of starting from scratch.
   - Suggested enhancing the self-learning aspect of the template by detailing active reflection logs and tutor prompts.
4. **Execution**:
   - Created the report at `7_Testing_Known/sanity_check_report.md`.
   - Logged the prompt in `prompts.md`.
   - Documented the thinking process in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`.
   - Next step is to commit and push changes.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Created `7_Testing_Known/sanity_check_report.md` containing the detailed evaluation.
- Updated `prompts.md` with the task metadata.
- Updated `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md` with the reasoning log.

---

## 📅 2026-05-30 — Open Report in Warp

### 📥 Input / Task
- Open the sanity check report in Warp terminal.
- Log the prompt in `prompts.md` and document the LLM thinking phase here in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Tool Identification**: Found that the target terminal application is Warp on macOS. The standard way to open a file in a specific application on macOS is using the `open` utility with the `-a` flag (e.g. `open -a Warp <filepath>`).
2. **Execution**: Proposed and executed the command `open -a Warp /Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/delivery-pilot-template/7_Testing_Known/sanity_check_report.md`.
3. **Commiting changes**: Since the template files `prompts.md` and `llm_thinking_log.md` were modified, these modifications will be committed and pushed to git as per the agent rules.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Opened `7_Testing_Known/sanity_check_report.md` in Warp.
- Updated `prompts.md` with prompt log metadata.
- Updated `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md` with reasoning log.

## 📅 2026-05-30 — Create Root index.html Template

### 📥 Input / Task
- Create a templated version of `index.html` at the project root to solve the missing file gap.
- Log the prompt in `prompts.md` and document the LLM thinking phase here.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Noticed that the root `index.html` was completely missing, which is a critical gap for GitHub Pages. The design standards call for rich dark mode aesthetics, two menus (Project Menu + Debug Menu), search autocomplete, cookie-based persistence for the debug toggle state, and dynamic simulation image carousel.
2. **Template Design**: Built a self-contained, responsive HTML5 document using Google Fonts, FontAwesome icons, HSL styling, and vanilla Javascript. Used cookie logic to preserve debug menu state, added interactive filter logic to implement autocomplete in the debug sidebar overlay, and wired a CSS transition-based image carousel.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Addressed structural gaps where `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `markdown_renderer.html`, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` were listed or required by rules/checklists but did not exist in the repository root.
2. **Template Design**:
   - `.env.example`: Designed to document variables for Azure Key Vault, local DB setups, and local Ollama/Qdrant services.
   - `markdown_renderer.html`: Built a responsive dark-themed renderer using Google Fonts, FontAwesome, marked.js, PrismJS (for syntaxes/linenos), and mermaid.js (for diagrams). Integrated the side debug toggle and autocomplete search matching `index.html`.
   - `.gitignore`: Configured to ignore environment secrets (`.env`), package directories (`node_modules`), OS cache files, and local caches of LLM configurations.
   - `robots.txt` & `sitemap.xml`: Prepared sitemaps and index specifications to satisfy SEO rules.
3. **Execution & Commits**: Create each file sequentially at the root, making separate commits and pushes for each task to respect versioning policies.
4. **Logs Updates**: Appended logs in `prompts.md` and registered these steps in `llm_thinking_log.md`.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Created `.env.example`.

## 📅 2026-05-30 — Open in Antigravity IDE

### 📥 Input / Task
- Open the workspace inside the Antigravity IDE environment.
- Log the prompt in `prompts.md` and document the LLM thinking phase here.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Investigated options to trigger opening of the workspace folder `/Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/delivery-pilot-template` in the native Antigravity IDE interface.
2. **Investigation**: Ran local path lookups to identify if any custom CLI utilities like `antigravity` or `antigravity-cli` were globally registered. Confirmed that the current execution context is already fully integrated as an agent session inside the Antigravity workspace, meaning the active files are already loaded and monitored by the user's active session.
3. **Execution**: Checked path configurations, recorded prompt in `prompts.md` and logged details here.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Confirmed the active workspace session is fully synced inside the Antigravity IDE environment.

- Update navigation config files to include this new markdown file.
- Log the prompt in `prompts.md` and document the LLM thinking phase here in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Analyze the Request**: The user wants a list of extensions/tools needed to run this project, to be placed in `4_Formula/` (the formulas folder). They explicitly mention fly.io, mermaid, azure, etc.
2. **Determine the Extensions**:
   - **VS Code / IDE Extensions**:
     - *Markdown Preview Enhanced* or *Mermaid Previewer* (for viewing mermaid diagrams locally).
     - *Azure Account* & *Azure Resources* (for Azure Key Vault secrets management).
     - *Fly.io* (if there's a CLI/extension for fly.io monitoring/deployment).
     - *YAML* (for docker-compose and fly.toml editing).
     - *Live Server* or similar (for running the static site locally easily).
   - **Deployment/Infrastructure Tools & Integrations (Extensions of the platform)**:
     - *Fly.io CLI (`flyctl`)*: for deploying the Python backend.
     - *Azure CLI (`az`)*: for Key Vault interaction.
     - *Git & GitHub CLI*: for repository management and pages deployment.
     - *Docker*: for local services like Qdrant and Ollama.
3. **Formulate the Document**: We will create `4_Formula/extensions.md` documenting these extensions and tools, mapping them to their purpose within the Delivery Pilot Template.
4. **Integration & Navigation Config**:
   - Register the file in `navigation_config.json` under `debugMenu`. Let's put it under `4. Formula` or as `   ├─ Required Extensions`.

## 📅 2026-06-07 — Share Navigation & Integrate Supabase Database

### 📥 Input / Task
- Document that navigation menu code should be shared (no duplication) inside `4_Formula/navigation.md`.
- Initialize/configure Supabase as the project database (with project name reflecting repository name: `delivery-pilot-template`).
- Document Supabase credential loading from Azure Key Vault in `4_Formula/database.md`.
- Update `.env.example`, `navigation_config.json`, fallback arrays, and `prompts.md`.
- Stage, commit, and push updates.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Analyze the Navigation Sharing Requirement**: The user wants us to document the "Navigation Reusability Formula" in the formulas stage. The core concept is sharing menu code dynamically through a configuration file (`navigation_config.json`) and client-side rendering scripts in both `index.html` and `markdown_renderer.html`. This keeps configuration in one place and avoids hardcoding/duplicating HTML layouts.
2. **Analyze the Supabase Requirement**:
   - We initialized Supabase locally using `npx supabase init`. The created `supabase/config.toml` contains `project_id = "delivery-pilot-template"`, which matches the GitHub repository name.
   - We must explain how Supabase credentials (URL, Anon Key, Service Role Key) are secured inside Azure Key Vault (dev/staging/prod vaults) and loaded at runtime into the application, rather than stored in the code.
   - Update `.env.example` to specify the new Supabase keys.
3. **Execution Plan**:
   - Log this plan in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md` and commit/push.
   - Add/commit `supabase/` config folder.
   - Create `4_Formula/navigation.md` (documents navigation sharing logic).
   - Create `4_Formula/database.md` (documents Supabase integration, naming conventions, and Key Vault retrieval).
   - Update `4_Formula/README.md` to include these files.
   - Update `navigation_config.json`, `index.html`, and `markdown_renderer.html` fallback config structures to add these links.
   - Update `.env.example` with Supabase placeholder variables.
   - Update `prompts.md` prompt log.
   - Finalize the LLM reasoning log in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Created `4_Formula/navigation.md` detailing the Shared Navigation pattern to avoid menu code duplication.
- Initialized local Supabase project named `delivery-pilot-template` using `npx supabase init`.
- Created `4_Formula/database.md` documenting Supabase config, naming standards, and Azure Key Vault secret injection mappings.
- Appended both files to the file index in `4_Formula/README.md`.
- Updated `.env.example` with Supabase credential placeholders (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, etc.).
- Registered both files in `navigation_config.json` and fallback configurations inside `index.html` and `markdown_renderer.html`.
- Logged the prompt in `prompts.md` and committed all files to Git main branch.

## 📅 2026-06-07 — Add Kanban Maintenance Task & Reread Commits

### 📥 Input / Task
- Add a maintenance task to go over commits, reread them, and create tasks to stay on track.
- Update `1_Real_Unknown/kanban.md` with this new maintenance task, mark completed tasks (like TSK-003, TSK-004) as Done, and add a completed task for the Supabase database setup.
- Log the prompt in `prompts.md` and document the LLM thinking phase here.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Analyze Requirements**:
   - The user wants a new maintenance task: "Go over commits, reread them, and create tasks to stay on track."
   - We will insert this task into `1_Real_Unknown/kanban.md` under `## ⚙️ Maintenance`.
   - In the spirit of the task ("reread commits and create/update tasks to stay on track"), we should reread our recent commits and update the Kanban board to reflect reality:
     - Mark `TSK-003` (Define Kanban Template) as completed (`[x]`).
     - Mark `TSK-004` (Configure Navigation & Menus) as completed (`[x]`).
     - Add `TSK-011` (Supabase Database Integration) to the `## ✅ Done` section since it was completed in the previous step.
2. **Execution Steps**:
   - Log this plan in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`.
   - Commit and push `llm_thinking_log.md`.
   - Edit `1_Real_Unknown/kanban.md` to add the maintenance task and update the task statuses.

## 2026-06-19 — Add Axiom, Supabase, Fly.io tools + tools overview + setup questionnaire

### 🧠 Thinking & Planning (before action)
- **Goal:** Add three tools to the stack — Axiom (server-side logs), Supabase (database/backend features), Fly.io (container-based deployments) — document them, provide one consolidated tools overview in `2_Environment`, and make `/init-project` ask setup questions.
- **Approach:**
  1. Fly.io doc already existed → re-titled to "Container-Based Deployments" and wired Supabase/Axiom into its integration section.
  2. Created `2_Environment/axiom.md` and `2_Environment/supabase.md` following the existing tool-doc shape (what/use cases/when/integration/setup/pricing/refs).
  3. Created `2_Environment/tools.md` as the single overview: stack-at-a-glance table, tool-by-tool, secrets map, data-flow diagram.
  4. Synced `architecture.md` Mermaid + components, `2_Environment/README.md` files table, `.env.example` secrets, and the debug menu (`navigation_config.json` + both HTML fallbacks).
  5. Updated `claude.md` Infrastructure section to list Deployments/Database/Logs.
  6. Added a setup questionnaire to `4_Formula/.claude/commands/init-project.md` so new projects choose tools consciously (asked via AskUserQuestion, recorded in prompts.md + decisions.md).

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Supabase chosen as the **primary database** (Postgres + auth + realtime + pgvector); Qdrant retained for dedicated vector workloads.
- Axiom is the **single source of truth for server-side logs**; secrets (`AXIOM_TOKEN`, `AXIOM_DATASET`) live in Azure Key Vault.
- Fly.io framed explicitly as **container-based (Docker) deployments**, the deploy target for backend code.
- All tool secrets centralized in the Secrets Map within `tools.md` and `.env.example` (placeholders only).

## 2026-06-19 — Logging & nightly continuous-fix formula

### 🧠 Thinking & Planning (before action)
- **Goal:** One formula doc covering (1) frontend logs via the existing footer debug feature, (2) backend logs via Axiom, and (3) a nightly agent that fixes errors when no one is actively coding.
- **Approach:**
  1. Grounded the doc in real code: the `debugLog`/`getCookie` utility and bottom-right `#debugToggle` button already in `index.html`/`markdown_renderer.html`. Proposed extending `debugLog` with a ring buffer, a footer "Logs" panel, global `onerror` capture, and backend-forwarding (so the Axiom token never lives in the browser).
  2. Backend = single writer to Axiom; defined the structured error shape and the tag fields (`trace`, `source`, `path`, `commit`, `count`) the fix agent needs.
  3. Nightly fix loop via the `/schedule` skill (cron `0 3 * * *`) with an **idle guard** (skip if uncommitted changes / recent commits / wip PR), Axiom→error.log cross-reference, smallest-safe-fix on a branch, `/verify`, fix.log entry, and **PR only — never auto-merge**.
- **Sync:** Added to `4_Formula/README.md` files table and the debug menu (navigation_config.json + both HTML fallbacks) per the menu-sync rule.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Frontend never holds the Axiom token; errors always forward, debug-level logs only when `debug=true`.
- Nightly agent is advisory-by-PR, bounded to trace-implicated files, idempotent, and stops on ambiguity (logs `[PENDING]`).

## 📅 2026-07-11 — Create Skills, Specs System, and Design-First Workflow

### 📥 Input / Task
- **Task 1:** `git pull` latest changes.
- **Task 2:** Instead of loading the full project context every time, create focused skill files that can be loaded on-demand. Commit, push, deploy.
- **Task 3:** Document that specs live in `4_Formula/specs.md`. New tasks must check specs, flag changes with `[NEEDS UPDATE]`, and warn before coding if behavior contradicts an active spec.
- **Task 4:** Create image-based designs in `3_Simulation/` and specs in `4_Formula/` before delivering implementation. Update these artifacts whenever the feature changes.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Git Pull**: Pulled latest changes from `origin/main` (README.md update, 1 commit ahead). Smooth fast-forward.

2. **Skill Creation (Task 2)**: Instead of loading the entire AGENTS.md and all persona files, I created lightweight `.kilo/skills/` files that encapsulate specific project capabilities:
   - `navigation.md` — Two-Menu sync workflow
   - `planning.md` — Formula/planning gate + specs system
   - `simulation.md` — Design-first imagery workflow
   - `deploy.md` — Git commit-push-deploy workflow
   - `secrets.md` — Azure Key Vault integration
   Each skill is self-contained and can be loaded on-demand via the `skill` tool, reducing context overhead.

3. **Specs System (Task 3)**: Created `4_Formula/specs.md` as the living specs document. It includes:
   - Spec system rules (check specs on new tasks, flag `[NEEDS UPDATE]`, warn on conflicts)
   - Active specs for existing features (Two-Menu, Markdown Renderer, Image Carousel, Secrets, Specs System itself)
   - A spec template for new features
   Updated all five rule files (`agents.md`, `claude.md`, `gemini.md`, `kilocode.md`, `copilot.md`) with the Specs System and Design-First rules.

4. **Design-First Workflow (Task 4)**: Created `3_Simulation/design_workflow.md` documenting:
   - Design-before-code rule: images in `3_Simulation/` + specs in `4_Formula/` gate `5_Symbols/`
   - Design workflow checklist
   - Image naming conventions
   - Integration with specs system
   Updated `3_Simulation/README.md` and `4_Formula/README.md` to include the new files.

5. **Navigation Sync**: Updated `navigation_config.json` and fallback debug menu arrays in both `index.html` and `markdown_renderer.html` to include `specs.md` and `design_workflow.md`.

6. **Commit Strategy**: Followed the project's commit-per-file rule, committing and pushing each file change individually (16 commits total).

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- 5 skill files created in `.kilo/skills/` plus `kilo.json` config.
- `4_Formula/specs.md` created with 5 active specs and a template.
- `3_Simulation/design_workflow.md` created as design-first process documentation.
- All agent persona files updated with Specs System and Design-First rules.
- All debug menu configurations synchronized across `navigation_config.json`, `index.html`, and `markdown_renderer.html`.
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub main branch.

## 📅 2026-07-11 — Encode 7-Stage Execution Flow in All Agent Files

### 📥 Input / Task
- When getting tasks: scan and map to `1_Real_Unknown` (OKRs) → update `2_Environment` blueprints (Mermaid/Excalidraw, always versioned) → design new versions in `3_Simulation` → specs and approval in `4_Formula` → implement in `5_Symbols` → test in `7_Testing_Known` → fix and resolve in `6_Semblance` (mention the resolution).

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Encoding the Full Cycle**: The user requested that the entire 7-stage lifecycle be explicitly encoded in `agents.md` and all agent persona files. Each stage now carries a clear action verb and purpose:
   - 1_Real_Unknown: Scan & Map (OKR alignment)
   - 2_Environment: Update Blueprints (Mermaid/Excalidraw, versioned)
   - 3_Simulation: Design New Versions (always new version images)
   - 4_Formula: Specs & Approval (mandatory gate)
   - 5_Symbols: Implement (only after approval)
   - 7_Testing_Known: Test & Report (loop back to 6 on failure)
   - 6_Semblance: Fix & Resolve (mention the resolution)
2. **Architectural Blueprints**: Added specific mention of Mermaid diagrams in `architecture.md` and Excalidraw diagrams, with the requirement to always keep them versioned.
3. **Execution**: Updated `agents.md` (restructured the stage descriptions into a numbered flow), then applied the same 7-stage execution flow block to all four agent persona files (`claude.md`, `gemini.md`, `kilocode.md`, `copilot.md`).

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- `agents.md` stage descriptions replaced with numbered 7-stage execution flow.
- All 4 agent persona files now include the same execution flow in their Behavior Guidelines.
- `2_Environment` blueprints now explicitly mention Mermaid and Excalidraw diagrams, versioned.
- Logged prompt in `prompts.md` and this reasoning in `llm_thinking_log.md`.
- All 5 files committed and pushed individually to GitHub main branch.

## 📅 2026-07-11 — Add Approval Cascade Rule (1+2 Gates 3+4)

### 📥 Input / Task
- Mention the changes and get approvals when they happen in `1_Real_Unknown` or `2_Environment`. These approved changes cascade into updates in `3_Simulation` and `4_Formula`. Encode this in `agents.md`.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Understanding the Chain**: The user clarified the stage gating mechanism. Stages 1 and 2 are the upstream planning stages. Changes there must be mentioned (documented) and approved before they propagate downstream into stages 3 (designs) and 4 (specs).
2. **Encoding the Rule**: Added a new step 3 in the 7-Stage Execution Flow: "Mention Changes & Get Approvals". Also added a standalone bullet "Mention Changes & Get Approvals" in all agent persona files.
3. **Cascade Logic**: `1_Real_Unknown` + `2_Environment` → mention changes → get approvals → update `3_Simulation` designs → update `4_Formula` specs → gate to `5_Symbols` code.
4. **Skill Sync**: Updated `.kilo/skills/planning.md` to include the Approval Cascade Rule section.
5. **Execution**: Applied changes to `agents.md`, `claude.md`, `gemini.md`, `kilocode.md`, `copilot.md`, and `.kilo/skills/planning.md`. Committed and pushed each individually.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- `agents.md` 7-Stage Execution Flow now contains 8 steps with the new "Mention Changes & Get Approvals" step.
- All 4 agent persona files include the standalone "Mention Changes & Get Approvals" rule.
- `.kilo/skills/planning.md` updated with Approval Cascade Rule section.
- Logged prompt in `prompts.md` and this reasoning in `llm_thinking_log.md`.
- All 6 files committed and pushed individually.

##  2026-07-11 — SPEC-006 Stage Dependency Chain + Dependencies Doc

###  Input / Task
- **Task 1:** Add a spec to `4_Formula/specs.md` outlining how `1_Real_Unknown`, `2_Environment`, and `3_Simulation` relate to each other.
- **Task 2:** Create `2_Environment/dependencies.md` documenting libraries, packages, dependencies, and how they affect each other on building and delivering this project.

###  Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **SPEC-006 Stage Dependency Chain**: Modeled the upstream stage relationships as a formal spec. The chain flows: `1_Real_Unknown` (why/OKRs) → `2_Environment` (what tools/blueprints) → `3_Simulation` (visual vision) → `4_Formula` (specs + approval) → `5_Symbols` (code). This makes explicit that stage 1 objective changes ripple through stage 2 tooling and stage 3 designs.
2. **Dependencies Document**: Created a comprehensive `2_Environment/dependencies.md` covering:
   - **Dependency chain overview** (Frontend CDN → Backend Docker → Infrastructure)
   - **Frontend dependencies** (FontAwesome, PrismJS, Google Fonts, marked.js) with upgrade impact assessments
   - **Backend dependencies** (Qdrant, Ollama, nomic-embed-text, Supabase, Azure SDK, Axiom SDK) with version constraints
   - **Cross-dependency matrix** showing which tools depend on each other
   - **Build & delivery flow** showing how dependencies map to the 7-stage structure
   - **Rules** for adding and upgrading dependencies
3. **Navigation Sync**: Added `dependencies.md` to `navigation_config.json` under `2. Environment`, and synced both HTML fallback arrays.
4. **Execution**: Updated `4_Formula/specs.md` (SPEC-006), created `2_Environment/dependencies.md`, updated `2_Environment/README.md`, `navigation_config.json`, `index.html`, `markdown_renderer.html`, `prompts.md`, and this log.

###  Outcomes & Decisions
- SPEC-006 added to `4_Formula/specs.md` defining the stage dependency chain.
- `2_Environment/dependencies.md` created with full dependency graph, cross-dependency matrix, and upgrade impact guide.
- `2_Environment/README.md` files table updated with dependencies.md entry.
- All debug menus synchronized with the new `Dependencies` entry under `2. Environment`.
- All 8 files committed and pushed individually to GitHub main branch.

## 📅 2026-07-11 — Smoke Tests, GitHub Issues Integration & 6_Semblance Reporting

### 📥 Input / Task
- When building functionality, add smoke tests that open pages and check for errors, then report the errors to GitHub Issues. Resolve them and add a report to `6_Semblance/`.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Smoke Test Strategy**: Authored `7_Testing_Known/smoke_tests.md` covering the full smoke test lifecycle:
   - **Test definitions**: Page load, Project Menu, Debug Menu, Markdown Renderer, Image Carousel, GitHub Edit, Navigation Config, Cookie Persistence, Responsive Layout
   - **GitHub Issues integration**: Template for creating issues, linking them in error.log, resolving with fix.log references
   - **Report format**: Standardized smoke test report template for `6_Semblance/smoke_test_report.md`
   - **Automation guide**: GitHub Actions workflow sketch for CI smoke testing
2. **Agent Rules Update**: Added the "Smoke Tests & GitHub Issues" rule to `agents.md` and all 4 agent persona files. Updated the 7-Stage Execution Flow steps 7-8 to explicitly mention smoke tests, GitHub Issues, and the smoke test report.
3. **Deploy Gate**: Updated `.kilo/skills/deploy.md` to include a Smoke Test Gate — no deployment proceeds unless all smoke tests pass.
4. **Navigation Sync**: Added `smoke_tests.md` entry under `7. Testing Known` in `navigation_config.json` and both HTML fallback arrays.
5. **Stage README**: Updated `7_Testing_Known/README.md` files table to include `smoke_tests.md`.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Test Agent now owns 3 responsibilities: smoke tests, code reviews, error documentation.
- All 5 agent files updated with the code review addition.
- 6 files committed and pushed individually.

## 📅 2026-07-11 — Risk Register in 1_Real_Unknown

### 📥 Input / Task
- In the real folder (`1_Real_Unknown/`), create a document called `risks.md`. With every update, add new risks and mention the ones that are solved.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Risk Identification**: Surveyed the entire project to identify real, current risks based on what we've encountered and what the project structure exposes:
   - **R-001** (Critical): Race conditions on parallel git pushes — documented 4+ times in this session
   - **R-002** (Medium): CDN dependency — FontAwesome, PrismJS, Google Fonts, marked.js are all CDN-hosted
   - **R-003** (Medium): Navigation config desync — 3 files must be manually kept in sync
   - **R-004** (Medium): Azure Key Vault unavailability — blocks all authenticated agent operations
   - **R-005** (Low): nomic-embed-text model upgrade breaking vectors
   - **R-006** (Low): Error-fix agent auto-merge guardrail bypass
   - **R-007** (High): Smoke tests not automated — currently manual
   - **R-008** (Medium): Single LLM dependency for agent persona generation
2. **Solved Risk Tracking**: Documented 6 risks that were recently solved by work done in this session:
   - R-S01: No specs system → `4_Formula/specs.md`
   - R-S02: Errors in production → `7_Testing_Known/smoke_tests.md`
   - R-S03: Inconsistent code → `5_Symbols/rules/`
   - R-S04: Full context loading → `.kilo/skills/`
   - R-S05: Unclear dependencies → `2_Environment/dependencies.md`
   - R-S06: No tool rationale → `2_Environment/toolstack.md`
3. **Risk Structure**: Each risk entry includes: Status (🔴🟠🟡🟢), Severity, Likelihood, Impact, Trigger, Mitigation, and Last Updated. The solved section maps each solved risk back to the work that resolved it.
4. **Integration**: Added to `1_Real_Unknown/README.md` files table and all 3 debug menu configurations.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- `1_Real_Unknown/risks.md` serves as the live risk register with 8 active and 6 solved risks.
- Risk review cadence defined: every project update, every milestone, smoke test failures, tool changes, LLM switches.
- Risk update log provides an audit trail of when risks were created and resolved.
- 6 files committed and pushed individually.

## 📅 2026-07-11 — Stage Agents Architecture (7 Dedicated Agents, One Per Folder)

### 📥 Input / Task
- Define specific agents managed in each folder, communicating through `llm_thinking_log.md`:
  - **Real Agent**: 1_Real_Unknown, objectives and key results
  - **Environment Agent**: 2_Environment, architectural requirements
  - **Simulation Agent**: 3_Simulation, visual designs with versions
  - **Formula Agent**: 4_Formula, specs from requirements + simulations, versioned
  - **Symbols Agent**: 5_Symbols, writes code based on Real, Environment, Formula agents
  - **Test Agent**: 7_Testing_Known, tests codebase, documents errors
  - **Semblance Agent**: 6_Semblance, works with Test to resolve errors, feeds back to Real

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Encoded a full 7-agent architecture in `agents.md`, where each stage folder has a dedicated agent with clear responsibilities: each agent owns its folder, reads from upstream agents, writes to downstream agents. Defined in a detailed table with columns: Agent, Folder, Role, Receives From, Delivers To.
2. **Agent Communication Protocol**: All agents communicate exclusively through `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`. Created a flow diagram showing how each agent writes to and reads from the thinking log, plus an Agent Rules Summary table showing what each agent reads/writes and key files.
3. **Execution Flow Integration**: Updated the 7-Stage Execution Flow in `agents.md` and all 4 persona files to include `→ [Agent Name]` references at the end of each step, making it clear which stage agent owns which step.
4. **Agent Chain**: `User Task → Real Agent (OKRs) → Environment Agent (blueprints) → Simulation Agent (designs) → Formula Agent (specs + approval) → Symbols Agent (code) → Test Agent (smoke tests) → Semblance Agent (fixes + lessons) → (feedback loop to Real Agent)`.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- `agents.md` now contains the "Stage Agents" section with 7-agent table, communication diagram, and rules summary.
- 7-Stage Execution Flow in all 5 agent files now includes agent name references.
- Clear separation: LLM persona files handle model-specific capabilities; stage agents handle folder-specific responsibilities.
- Agent communication channel is `llm_thinking_log.md` — the single log where every agent documents its reasoning.
- 5 files committed and pushed individually to GitHub main branch.

---

##  2026-07-11 — Code Review Added as Test Agent Responsibility

###  Input / Task
- Add code review to Test Agent responsibilities. Ensure all agent responsibilities are clearly mentioned in agents.md.

###  Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Test Agent Enhancement**: Added "conducts code reviews" to the Test Agent's role in all 3 locations within `agents.md`: the Stage Agents table, the Agent Rules Summary table, and the 7-Stage Execution Flow step 7.
2. **All 4 Persona Files**: Updated the Test Agent step in every persona file to include "**Conduct code reviews** on the implementation."
3. **Full Responsibilities Audit**: Verified that all 7 agents have their responsibilities clearly stated across the table, the summary, and the execution flow — Real (OKRs), Environment (blueprints), Simulation (designs), Formula (specs + approval), Symbols (code), Test (tests + code reviews), Semblance (fixes + lessons).

###  Outcomes & Decisions
- Test Agent now owns 3 responsibilities: smoke tests, code reviews, error documentation.
- All 5 agent files updated with the code review addition.
- 6 files committed and pushed individually.

---

## 📅 2026-07-11 — Code Drift Detection Added to Formula Agent Responsibility

### 📥 Input / Task
- Formula Agent should be responsible for identifying code drift from specs.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Responsibility Mapping**: The Formula Agent already owns `specs.md`, gates code entry to `5_Symbols`, and manages the approval process. Detecting drift between the written spec and implemented code is a natural extension of the gating role.
2. **Changes Applied**:
   - **AGENTS.md** (3 locations): Stage Agents table, Agent Rules Summary, 7-Stage Execution Flow step 4
   - **All 4 persona files**: 7-Stage Execution Flow step 4
   - **4_Formula/specs.md**: Added rule 5 + SPEC-007 active spec
   - **.kilo/skills/planning.md**: Added drift detection to Specs System section
3. **Drift Format**: Deviations flagged with `[DRIFT]` in spec entries, documented in thinking log with gap analysis.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Formula Agent now explicitly responsible for identifying code drift across all 5 agent definition files.
- SPEC-007 created as an active spec defining the drift detection workflow.
- 9 files modified, committed and pushed.

---

## 📅 2026-07-11 — Token Usage Monitoring Added to Environment Agent + Fix Agent to Test Agent

### 📥 Input / Task
- Token usage monitoring and cost spike warnings are the Environment Agent's responsibility.
- Test Agent is responsible for running the Semblance (fix) Agent for end-to-end testing, fixing errors along the way.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Environmental Agent**: Added "Monitors token usage, warns on cost spikes and unexpected LLM spend" to the Environment Agent role across 3 locations in AGENTS.md and all 4 persona files. Added monitoring thresholds and spike alert log to `1_Real_Unknown/costs.md`.
2. **Test Agent**: Changed the error escalation flow from "create GitHub Issue and loop to 6_Semblance" to "activate the Semblance Agent for end-to-end testing — errors are fixed along the way before escalating." Updated the Stage Agents table, Rules Summary, and execution flow step 7 in AGENTS.md, plus all 4 persona files.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- Environment Agent now owns token monitoring with defined spike thresholds and alert procedures.
- Test Agent drives the fix agent inline during testing rather than deferring to a separate loop.
- Error flow: Test finds issue → drives Semblance to fix → Test re-validates → resolved.
- All files committed and pushed.

---

## 📅 2026-07-12 — Smoke Test Runner, Debug Menu Backfill, Sanity Report Loop (7 → 1)

### 📥 Input / Task
- Task 1: Create a template-adapted smoke test that scans the pages, runs the checks, and generates a sample `6_Semblance/smoke_test_report.md`.
- Task 2: Add the absent markdown files (found by the 2026-07-12 sanity check) to the debug menu.
- Task 3: Make `1_Real_Unknown` the canonical sanity report location — it consumes data from `7_Testing_Known` and returns to Stage 1, completing the loop.
- Task 4: Update `1_Real_Unknown/sanity_check_report.md` to reflect the fixes.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Template adaptation**: The smoke test must not hardcode this project's file list — it reads `navigation_config.json` as the single source of truth, so any project bootstrapped from the template inherits working smoke tests. Python stdlib only (no npm/pip installs), so it runs anywhere and in CI.
2. **Local + cloud**: Default mode checks the local filesystem; `--base-url` mode fetches the deployed GitHub Pages site over HTTP — matching the Test Agent rule to test in both environments.
3. **Placement**: Runner goes to `5_Symbols/toolbox/` (source code belongs in 5_Symbols; toolbox already hosts `count.sh`). Report output goes to `6_Semblance/smoke_test_report.md` per the Smoke Tests & GitHub Issues rule. Specced as SPEC-008 before implementation.
4. **Debug menu backfill**: 27 absent files added to all 3 nav sources (`navigation_config.json`, `index.html` fallback, `markdown_renderer.html` fallback) in one pass; stage READMEs listed as "Overview" entries. This resolves sanity finding F-003 and downgrades risk R-003 (the smoke test now detects future desync automatically).
5. **Loop design (SPEC-009)**: Stage 7 produces test evidence; the Real Agent's sanity sub-agent consumes it and publishes the verdict in Stage 1 against the OKRs — 1 → … → 7 → 1. The outdated 2026-05-30 Stage-7 report moves to `_obsolete/` per the lifecycle rule, and `7_Testing_Known/sanity_check_report.md` becomes the data-source pointer doc.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- SPEC-008 (smoke test runner) and SPEC-009 (sanity report loop) added as active specs.
- `5_Symbols/toolbox/smoke_test.py` implemented; first run generated `6_Semblance/smoke_test_report.md`.
- Debug menu synchronized across all 3 sources with the full stage inventory.
- Sanity report loop documented; Stage-1 report updated with resolved findings (F-002, F-003).

## 📅 2026-07-12 — Template Restructure: File Moves, Placeholders, Skills, CI/CD Gate

### 📥 Input / Task
- Move `supabase/` → `2_Environment/supabase/`; move `prompts.md` → `1_Real_Unknown/`; move `markdown_renderer.html` → `5_Symbols/` and fix links.
- Document template consumption (placeholders + bootstrap steps for consumer LLM agents) in all 5 agent files.
- Add Claude Code skills to the project.
- Check and fix reference/template-reuse issues; commit, push, deploy; make CI/CD (smoke gate in `static.yml`) the Formula Agent's responsibility.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Renderer move is the risky one**: the renderer fetches `navigation_config.json` and the `?file=` target relative to its own location. Decision: keep `?file=` parameters root-relative everywhere and prefix all internal fetches/links inside the renderer with `../`. `index.html` routes md links through `5_Symbols/markdown_renderer.html?file=…`. SPEC-002 updated.
2. **Template reuse**: the GitHub edit URL was hardcoded — now derived from `location.hostname`/`pathname` on `*.github.io`, with the configured repo as local fallback. Placeholder convention specced as SPEC-010; project-specific values enumerated so consumers know exactly what to replace.
3. **Supabase caveat**: the Supabase CLI conventionally expects `supabase/` at the repo root; after the move to `2_Environment/supabase/`, CLI use requires `--workdir 2_Environment` (documented in `4_Formula/database.md`).
4. **Skills**: `.claude/skills/` (unignored via `.gitignore` exception) with smoke-test, nav-sync, and sanity-check skills wrapping the SPEC-008 runner and the menu regeneration script (`5_Symbols/toolbox/nav_sync.py`, promoted from scratchpad so the skill has a stable target).
5. **CI/CD ownership**: `static.yml` gains a `smoke` job (SPEC-008 runner, CI-compatible exit code) that gates the `deploy` job — closing risk R-007. The Formula Agent owns this pipeline per its "Manage CI/CD" mandate (Continuous Integration = smoke gate, Continuous Delivery = artifact upload, Continuous Deployment = Pages deploy on every green main push).

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- SPEC-002 revised (renderer in `5_Symbols`, root-relative `?file=`, derived edit URL); SPEC-010 added (template consumption); smoke gate wired into `static.yml`.
- All moves executed with `git mv`; references fixed; local + cloud smoke tests green before completion.

## 📅 2026-09-10 — Agent Operating Rules (spec what you did + commit/push)

### 📥 Input / Task
- Add a rules file agents can use.
- Mention standing rules: always formulate as a spec on what you have done and add it to the Formula folder; commit and push.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. **Where it lives:** Coding rules already sit in `5_Symbols/rules/` (`coding_standards.md`, `git_conventions.md`, `file_organization.md`). A new `agent_operating_rules.md` in that folder is the file agents load, without splitting "rules" across random folders.
2. **What was missing:** Specs existed as a *before-code* gate (SPEC-005). The user asked for the *after-work* habit: formulate **what you did** as a spec in Formula. Commit-and-push already lived in `agents.md` and `git_conventions.md` but was not a scannable standing order next to the spec habit.
3. **Coordinator vs rules file:** `agents.md` stays the coordinator. It now points at the operating-rules file. Persona files get a short pointer so every LLM inherits the same two non-negotiables (RULE-001, RULE-002).
4. **Spec of the work:** SPEC-011 records the delivered behavior. Spec System Rules gain item 6 so Formula itself encodes "spec what you did."

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- `5_Symbols/rules/agent_operating_rules.md` is the standing-orders file (RULE-001 spec-as-delivered, RULE-002 commit and push).
- SPEC-011 added; Spec System Rules item 6 added.
- Coordinator and persona files point at the rules file. Debug menu lists it under Stage 5.

---

## 📅 2026-09-10 — RULE-003/004: backend deploy + Azure project storage

### 📥 Input / Task
- Mention in the rules: apps with a backend deploy to Fly.io or Cloudflare Workers based on requirements; heavy container requirements go to Fly.io; both take credentials from Azure Key Vault.
- Rule: the project default storage is Azure project-based storage.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. Existing Environment docs treated Fly.io as *the* backend and Workers as optional edge. The new standing order is a **choice**: lightweight/stateless → Workers; heavy containers → Fly.io. Architecture and fly_io/cloudflare pages must match or agents will follow the old "all backends on Fly.io" line.
2. Credentials stay on SPEC-004 (Key Vault). RULE-003 only makes it explicit that **both** deploy targets pull from the vault.
3. "Azure project-based storage" = one Azure Storage account (blob) scoped to the project, as the default for files/blobs. Supabase remains the structured-data option; Fly volumes / R2 are exceptions, not defaults.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- RULE-003 and RULE-004 added to `agent_operating_rules.md`.
- SPEC-012 records the delivered deploy + storage contract; SPEC-004 notes Workers + Azure Storage keys in the vault.
- Architecture diagram updated so Workers can be a backend (not only a proxy to Fly.io) and Azure Storage is the default blob store.

## 📅 2026-09-10 — RULE-005: allowed root folders; move extras

### 📥 Input / Task
- Root folders are: `.claude/skills`, `.github/workflows`, `.kilo/skills`, and the seven stages.
- Create a rule to move anything else into related subfolders of those.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. The user listed **folders**, not a bare root. GitHub Pages still requires `index.html` (and related SEO/config files) at the repo root; the coordinator personas live at root by contract. Those stay as **files**, not extra folders.
2. Workflows were previously described as living under `5_Symbols/.github/` in `file_organization.md` — that contradicts `.github/workflows` as an allowed root folder. Updated the placement rule so CI stays at repo-root `.github/workflows/`.
3. Agents must `git mv` strays, update refs, nav-sync if paths change — not invent new top-level dirs.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- RULE-005 + SPEC-013. `file_organization.md` restated to match. Coordinator/personas point at RULE-005.

## 📅 2026-09-10 — Refactor/Init prompts + apply RULE-005 to this repo

### 📥 Input / Task
- Update the Refactor command in README.md to reflect the standing rules.
- Fix this project properly using those rules.

### 💭 Thinking & Reasoning Process
1. The README Refactor/Init blocks are the prompts consumer agents paste. They had "place files logically" and commit/push, but not RULE-001–005, allowed root folders, Workers vs Fly.io, Azure storage, or nav-sync/smoke-test. Those belong in the pasteable prompt so a weaker model still follows them.
2. This repo itself violated RULE-005: `kilo.json` sat at the root. Move to `.kilo/kilo.json` and retarget references.
3. Enforce layout with a smoke check so CI fails if someone parks a new top-level folder again. SPEC-008 and SPEC-010 updated.

### 📤 Outcomes & Decisions
- README Refactor + Init prompts encode RULE-001–005, Key Vault `/vaults/dp-kv-deliverypilot/secrets` (do not create a new vault), then nav-sync + smoke-test.
- `kilo.json` → `.kilo/kilo.json`. Smoke test **Root Layout (RULE-005)** added.
