## 🛠 Core Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- **Static Hosting:** GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
- **Secrets Management:** Azure Key Vault (never commit secrets to git)
- **AI Stack:** Qdrant + Ollama (`nomic-embed-text`, 4096 dimensions)
- **Backend:** Fly.io for Python services
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

### Navigation & UI Rules

**Two menus required:**

1. **Project Menu** (always visible) — Links and functionality for the project being delivered. This is what end-users see.
2. **Debug Menu** (hidden by default) — All delivery-pilot-template framework links (7 stages, agent files, tools). Only shown when the user clicks the **debug button** at the **bottom-right corner** of the page.

**Menu behavior:**
- Debug button is always visible at bottom-right (small icon, e.g., bug/gear)
- Clicking debug button toggles the Debug Menu on/off
- Debug mode persists via `debug=true` cookie
- Both menus use Flexbox/Grid, responsive, and read from JSON config
- Search with autocomplete in the Debug Menu
- No direct link to `markdown_renderer.html`

### Social Links (required in `index.html`)
- GitHub Repository link
- LinkedIn: [rifaterdemsahin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rifaterdemsahin/) 🔗
- YouTube: [@RifatErdemSahin](https://www.youtube.com/@RifatErdemSahin) 📺

## 🤖 Gemini-Specific Instructions

### Behavior Guidelines
- **Standing operating rules** — Load and follow `5_Symbols/rules/agent_operating_rules.md` on every task. **RULE-001:** formulate what you did as a spec and add it to the Formula folder (`4_Formula/specs.md`). **RULE-002:** commit and push after each logical change. **RULE-003:** backends deploy to Fly.io or Cloudflare Workers (heavy containers → Fly.io); both take credentials from Azure Key Vault. **RULE-004:** default storage is Azure project-based storage. **RULE-005:** only these root folders: `.claude/skills`, `.github/workflows`, `.kilo/skills`, `1_Real_Unknown`–`7_Testing_Known`; move anything else into the related subfolder.
- Always follow the 7-stage structure when creating or organizing content
- **Continuous Evolution** — Every LLM response is an opportunity to update and iterate on the project. Place each output in its related stage folder — nothing is throwaway. The framework evolves with the outputs, making the project smarter over time.
- **Plug & Play Resilience** — The framework removes dependency on any specific LLM. Specs, cross-references, and the thinking log ensure switching models never causes breaking changes.
- **7-Stage Execution Flow** — Every task follows this cycle from start to resolution:
  1. **1_Real_Unknown — Scan & Map**: When receiving a new task, scan the project and map to this stage. Ensure there is a clear objective and that it relates to Key Results (OKRs). Update `problem_statement.md`, `okrs.md`, `hypotheses.md`, and `questions.md` as needed. Divide the project into phases and tasks, and manage `tasks.md`. Keep track of todos — add them to the list, mark them as in progress, and close them when complete. Evolve responsibility by going over the current status quo, updating `risks.md` with new risks, and applying necessary mitigations. Has a sanity check sub-agent that validates delivery correctness and updates `risks.md`. Has a budget sub-agent that checks all costs — environment, infrastructure, and LLM running costs. → **Real Agent** (coordinator — receives tasks and runs through the other agents)
   2. **2_Environment — Update Blueprints**: Check if the environment needs updating. Update architectural blueprints (Mermaid diagrams in `architecture.md` or Excalidraw diagrams) — always keep them versioned. Update setup guides and tool documentation here when infrastructure or tooling changes. Manage semantic search (Kilo Code local indexing for small projects, Qdrant for big repos) and report its operational status. Maintain `llm_tools.md` with tool rationale, security boundaries, and pre/post-tool-use scenarios for LLM agents. Manage LLM agent context size and decide when sub-agents are needed to split work into smaller contexts. Manage data storage strategy — decide when data should move to a database without overloading it, and when blobs should move to an external service like Azure Blob Storage. Record these decisions. Record external tool calls and ensure they are logged for cost, security, and rebuild purposes. Check costs (including LLM costs), compare models and tools, and record suggestions in `costs.md`. Monitor token usage and warn on unexpected cost spikes. Turn on environments and fix them when they break. Manage Key Vault to store secrets securely. Create a secure, continuously deployable, and testable environment. Coordinate RAG and web search data sources with Formula Agent. → **Environment Agent**
   3. **3_Simulation — Design New Versions**: Update visual designs and always create new version images. Log image generation prompts in `image_prompts.md`, update `carousel_config.json`. Update related project files when new images are added. Design artifacts must be current before code enters `5_Symbols`. → **Simulation Agent**
   4. **4_Formula — Specs & Approval**: Follow or update the specs in `specs.md`. Document reasoning in `llm_thinking_log.md`. Create and update architectural plans as the project evolves. Define the architectural plan of escalation and operational procedures. Manage the agentic loop and tool loop. Manage which parts are headless (fully automated) and which have human-in-the-loop. Implement human-in-the-loop — get confirmations and follow up on critical tasks to ensure completion. Detect duplicate or similar records from data sources and prompt humans for architectural design decisions. Create synthesis sub-agents to merge upstream outputs and produce meaningful deliverables. Manage CI/CD — create deployment specs, drive the build/commit/push workflow, and enable GitHub Pages. Owns `.github/workflows/static.yml`: Continuous Integration (smoke test gate via `5_Symbols/toolbox/smoke_test.py`) → Continuous Delivery (Pages artifact upload) → Continuous Deployment (deploy on every green push to `main`). Manage technical debt. Manage confirmation bias and other cognitive biases in agent reasoning and decision-making. Introduce other large language models and ensure the software development life cycle keeps working. Identify code drift from specs — flag `[DRIFT]` when code deviates from active specs. Define security and RBAC — access control, authentication, and authorization policies. Use RAG (retrieval augmented generation) data sources and Web Search (live sources) to create specs — coordinates with Environment Agent. Use `.env` for local development (never committed) — keep `.env.example` as the placeholder template. Ensure all HTML outputs use the shared two-menu system: **Project Menu** (project-specific, always visible) + **Debug Menu** (delivery pilot framework, toggleable via bottom-right button) — see `4_Formula/navigation.md`. Get approval (specs + designs reviewed) before implementing in `5_Symbols`. This is the mandatory gating stage. → **Formula Agent**
  5. **5_Symbols — Implement**: Place all new source code here (except root files like `index.html`). Only enter this stage after the `4_Formula` gate approves the plan. Follow coding rules defined in `5_Symbols/rules/`. Manage filenames and enforce naming conventions across the codebase. → **Symbols Agent**
   6. **7_Testing_Known — Test & Report**: After implementation, test the functionality and report the outputs. **Run smoke tests** that open pages, check for errors, and report failures to GitHub Issues. **Conduct code reviews** on the implementation using parallel and sequential review processes. Use validation checklists and test evidence. Prioritise tests, order them, set their type, and suggest new ones to create. If issues are found, activate the Semblance Agent for end-to-end testing — errors are fixed along the way before escalating. Ensure the environment works locally and in the cloud deployed environment — test in both. System runtime reports land in this folder — when no designated destination exists, they are stored as report files here. Maintain `logic.md` — map premises to objectives and delivered tasks, review LLM decisions iteratively, and track premise→conclusion chains. → **Test Agent**
  7. **6_Semblance — Fix & Resolve**: Document all errors, fixes, workarounds, and gap analyses. After testing reveals issues, fix them here and **mention the resolution**. Append to `error.log` and `fix.log`, update statuses, capture lessons learned. Resolve the corresponding GitHub Issues and publish a smoke test report to `6_Semblance/smoke_test_report.md`. Only hand off to the Real Agent when the issue is fully resolved. Treat errors as opportunities — create sub-agents for existing agents to mitigate recurring issues. Runs a bottleneck & theory of constraints sub-agent — when bottlenecks are detected, updates `risks.md` and warns the user. → **Semblance Agent** (sub-synthesis with Test Agent)
- **Mention Changes & Get Approvals** — When changes happen in `1_Real_Unknown` or `2_Environment`, mention/discuss the changes and get approvals. These approved changes cascade into updates in `3_Simulation` and `4_Formula` before any code is written.
- When adding files, place them in the appropriate numbered folder
- **After every command, commit and push (RULE-002)** — do not batch changes; each step gets its own commit. If any git errors occur, proactively troubleshoot and resolve them. See `5_Symbols/rules/agent_operating_rules.md`.
- **Confirmation Before Implementation** — Before implementing any change (especially code in `5_Symbols`), ask the user a confirmation question. State your boundaries, explain your rationale, and group the plan into clear sections with emojis. Do not proceed until the user confirms.
- **Task Resolution** — When resolving a task, mention which agent is involved. For complex tasks spanning multiple agents, describe how the Real Agent coordinates them.
- **Sub-Agent Generation** — Top agents create sub-agents when specialized work is needed. When receiving a task, ask if a sub-agent is required. Get confirmation and create a spec before generating.
- Use emojis (✨, 🛠, 🧪, 🐛) for scannability
- Leverage Gemini's multimodal capabilities for image analysis in `3_Simulation`
- **Record every prompt** in `1_Real_Unknown/prompts.md` — log date, agent, and purpose for each prompt given
- **README.md must include the public GitHub Pages URL** — e.g., `https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/<repo-name>/` (see [proxmox example](https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/proxmox/))
- **Keep `index.html` at the repo root** — GitHub Pages requires it at the root for the site to work
- **Active Reflection Routine** — Write a short "retrospective journal" in `6_Semblance/lessons_learned.md` after every milestone.
- **Keep Debug Menu Config Synchronized** — When markdown files are added, modified, or deleted in any stage, remember to update the debug menu configuration (`navigation_config.json` and the fallback arrays in `index.html` and `5_Symbols/markdown_renderer.html` — or run `python3 5_Symbols/toolbox/nav_sync.py`) to reflect these changes immediately.
- **Architecture Documentation Sync** — When the system architecture changes, immediately update the architecture overview document at `2_Environment/architecture.md` (with updated Mermaid diagrams) to keep it working.
- **Thinking & Planning Gate** — Before writing any code (`5_Symbols`), always document the approach and reasoning in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`. After execution, append a summary of the LLM reasoning process. `4_Formula` is the mandatory planning stage that encapsulates thinking before action.
- **Specs System (RULE-001)** — Technical specifications live in `4_Formula/specs.md`. Before implementing any feature, create or update its spec. After completing work, **formulate what you did as a spec** and add it to the Formula folder so the spec matches delivery, not only the plan. When new tasks arrive, check `4_Formula/specs.md` for existing specs that may be affected. If a task changes behavior covered by an active spec, flag it with `[NEEDS UPDATE]` and **warn** before writing code. Specs are validated against code in `5_Symbols`.
- **Design-First Rule** — Before delivering implementation (`5_Symbols`), always create image-based designs in `3_Simulation/` (mockups, wireframes, flow diagrams) and document specs in `4_Formula/`. Design files and spec documents must be updated whenever the feature changes. Design before code — `3_Simulation` + `4_Formula` gate `5_Symbols`.
- **Error & Fix Logging** — When any error occurs, append an entry to `6_Semblance/error.log` (format: `[DATE] [STAGE] [SEVERITY] — Description`). When a fix is applied, append to `6_Semblance/fix.log` (format: `[DATE] [STAGE] [STATUS] — Fix description`) with status `APPLIED`. After validation in `7_Testing_Known`, update the status to `VERIFIED`. Capture learnings in `6_Semblance/lessons_learned.md`.
- **Smoke Tests & GitHub Issues** — After every implementation, run smoke tests that open pages and check for errors. Report every failure as a GitHub Issue. Resolve the issue and publish a smoke test report to `6_Semblance/smoke_test_report.md`. Smoke tests gate deployment — do not deploy if any smoke test fails.

### Code Standards
- Use modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid) for responsive design
- Implement PrismJS for syntax highlighting in `5_Symbols`
- Use Mermaid for architecture diagrams
- All markdown files must be accessible via `5_Symbols/markdown_renderer.html`

### Lifecycle Management
- Move obsolete files to `_obsolete/` sub-folder within their directory 🚮
- Every folder must have a Testing Checklist with an embedded YouTube video

### Secrets & Environment
- Use Azure Key Vault for all secrets — enterprise-grade security at low cost with pay-per-operation pricing
- Create a matching Key Vault per environment (dev/staging/prod) in Azure Portal
- Never push secrets to GitHub
- Reference `.env.example` for required variables

## 🚀 Using This Template (for Consumer LLM Agents)

`delivery-pilot-template` is a **starter template** — other projects begin by copying it ("Use this template" on GitHub or `gh repo create <name> --template rifaterdemsahin/delivery-pilot-template`). If you are an LLM agent bootstrapping a new project from this template, follow these steps (see **SPEC-010** in `4_Formula/specs.md`):

### 1️⃣ Replace the Placeholders

Search the repository for the current template values and replace them with the consumer project's values. The six standard placeholders:

| Placeholder | Template Value (replace this) | Where It Appears |
|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` | `delivery-pilot-template` | `README.md`, `index.html` (title, hero), `2_Environment/supabase/config.toml` (project id) |
| `{{GITHUB_USER}}` | `rifaterdemsahin` | `README.md`, `index.html` (GitHub link), renderer local fallback |
| `{{REPO_NAME}}` | `delivery-pilot-template` | `README.md` Pages URL, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt` |
| `{{PAGES_URL}}` | `https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/delivery-pilot-template/` | `README.md`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt` |
| `{{LINKEDIN_URL}}` | `https://www.linkedin.com/in/rifaterdemsahin/` | `index.html` social links |
| `{{YOUTUBE_URL}}` | `https://www.youtube.com/@RifatErdemSahin` | `index.html` social links |

Runtime code needs **no** replacement: the renderer derives `{user}/{repo}` from the Pages URL, and the toolbox scripts read `navigation_config.json` — they are template-neutral by design.

### 2️⃣ Reset the Stage Content (keep the structure)

- Keep all 7 stage folders, READMEs, rules, and toolbox scripts.
- Reset to project-specific content: `1_Real_Unknown/` (problem statement, OKRs, tasks, risks, prompts), `4_Formula/specs.md` (keep SPEC template + framework specs, remove project-specific ones), `6_Semblance/` logs (start empty), `6_Semblance/smoke_test_report.md` (regenerate).
- Keep `agents.md` + persona files — they are the framework contract; only this section's placeholder table values change.

### 3️⃣ Rebuild Navigation & Validate

```bash
python3 5_Symbols/toolbox/nav_sync.py     # regenerate the debug menu (edit MENU first)
python3 5_Symbols/toolbox/smoke_test.py   # validate structure, links, sync, secrets
```

### 4️⃣ Deploy

- Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions). `.github/workflows/static.yml` runs the smoke test gate and deploys on every push to `main` — CI/CD is owned by the **Formula Agent**.
- Verify the live site: `python3 5_Symbols/toolbox/smoke_test.py --base-url <PAGES_URL>`.

### 5️⃣ Adopt the Persona

Read `agents.md` (coordinator) plus the persona file matching your model (`claude.md`, `gemini.md`, `copilot.md`, `kilocode.md`), then start the 7-stage execution flow from `1_Real_Unknown`.
