# 5️⃣ Symbols — The "Reality"

> **Stage 5 of 7:** The actual code — where vision becomes working software.

## Purpose

This folder contains the **core source code and implementation files**. Everything that runs, executes, or is deployed lives here. Code is rendered with PrismJS syntax highlighting for readable documentation.

## What belongs here

- **Source code** — All scripts, modules, and application code
- **Configuration files** — App config (non-secret)
- **Docker definitions** — `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- **GitHub Actions workflows** — CI/CD pipeline definitions
- **Static assets** — JS, CSS bundles used by the app

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `main.py` | Primary application entry point |
| `Dockerfile` | Container build definition |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Multi-service orchestration |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI/CD pipeline definitions |
| `rules/` | **Rules agents load** — operating rules (spec what you did + commit/push), coding standards, git conventions, file organization |

## Code Standards

- **Syntax highlighting:** PrismJS (included via CDN in all HTML pages)
- **Style:** Modern CSS — Flexbox/Grid, no legacy floats
- **Diagrams:** Mermaid for all architecture and flow diagrams
- **Backend:** Python on Fly.io
- **Frontend:** Static HTML/CSS/JS on GitHub Pages

## Secrets

- **Never** store secrets in this folder
- Use `.env.example` in root to document required variables
- Load secrets at runtime via Azure Key Vault

## Rules

- Keep `main.py` minimal — delegate to modules
- Every function that isn't self-evident gets a comment
- Move deprecated code to `_obsolete/` 🚮

## 🧪 Testing Checklist
